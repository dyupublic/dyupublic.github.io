DS 2000 Programming with Data introduces programming for data and information science through case studies in business, sports, education, social science, economics, and the natural world. Presents key concepts in programming, data structures, and data analysis through Python and Excel. Integrates the use of data analytics libraries and tools. Surveys techniques for acquiring and programmatically integrating data from different sources. Explains the data analytics pipeline and how to apply programming at each stage. Discusses the programmatic retrieval of data from application programming interfaces (APIs) and from databases. Introduces predictive analytics for forecasting and classification. Demonstrates the limitations of statistical techniques.

DS 4420 Machine Learning and Data Mining 2 continues with supervised and unsupervised predictive modeling, data mining, and machine-learning concepts. Covers mathematical and computational aspects of learning algorithms, including kernels, time-series data, collaborative filtering, support vector machines, neural networks, Bayesian learning and Monte Carlo methods, multiple regression, and optimization. Uses mathematical proofs and empirical analysis to assess validity and performance of algorithms. Studies additional computational aspects of probability, statistics, and linear algebra that support algorithms. Requires programming in R and Python. Applies concepts to common problem domains, including spam filtering.
