  <b>Research interest</b>: I am particularly interested in leveraging text data 
  to better understand individual and community health. 
  I apply natural language processing and machine learning 
  on large-scale health data with a focus on modeling problems 
  and proposing novel algorithms for real-world applications 
  including but not limited to social media and medical data.
  <br><br>
  Given my passion for teaching and learning, I'm also open to explore research in pedagogy.
