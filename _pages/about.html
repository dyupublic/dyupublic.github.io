<p>
  I'm an assistant teaching professor 
  at <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/" taget="_blank">Khoury College of Computer Sciences, Northeastern University</a>.
  I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Michigan, with a dissertation titled 
  <i><a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/194449/deahanyu_1.pdf" target="_blank">Natural Language Processing Approaches for Monitoring Health Activities</a></i>,
  supervised by <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/people/vg-vinod-vydiswaran" target="_blank">VG Vinod Vydiswaran</a>. 
  I spent many years at Michigan, where I completed both a Ph.D. and a Master of Health Informatics.
  Before that, I was in Pittsburgh, PA, where I earned a B.S. in Statistics from Carnegie Mellon University. 
  <br><br>
  My academic journey has naturally fueled my passion for teaching and research. 
  I teach Data Science and conduct research focused on understanding individual and community health. 
  I'm also very interested in outreach, especially for high school students, as well as other ways to help students learn and grow.
  I'd love to connect and collaborate. Please feel free to reach out!
